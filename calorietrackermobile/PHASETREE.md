## üîç Phase 0: Assessment & Planning
**üéØ GOAL**: Understand current system and plan minimal changes for maximum mobile value

### 0.1 Current System Analysis
- [‚úÖ] **Backend API Audit & Documentation**: Systematically identify and document all existing Flask routes (API endpoints), their HTTP methods, expected request parameters, and JSON response structures. This will be captured in a dedicated `backend_api_audit.md` file within the `calorietrackermobile` directory.
- [‚úÖ] **Database Schema Review & Documentation**: Analyze `db_handler_orm.py`, `db_orm.py`, and `models.py` to document the current database schema, including tables, columns, relationships, and data types. This will also be part of `backend_api_audit.md`.
- [‚úÖ] **Web App Compatibility Assessment**: Identify any parts of the existing web application's functionality (e.g., session management, cookie handling) that might not translate directly to a mobile API, and note potential challenges.
- [‚úÖ] **Family Data Safety - Enhanced Planning**: Detail specific procedures for creating production backups, including exact commands/scripts, storage location, frequency during development, and a clear "point of no return" definition before any database schema modifications.

### 0.2 Simplified Requirements Discovery
- **Mobile-Ready APIs**: Confirm and list the specific existing API endpoints from `backend_api_audit.md` that are suitable for direct mobile use without modification (e.g., `/api/profiles`, `/api/profile/<name>`, `/api/add_food`, `/api/food_database`, `/api/weight`, `/api/goal`, `/api/home`, `/api/summary`, `/api/history`, `/api/calorie_graph`, `/api/weight_history`).
- **Required Backend API Enhancements**: Detail the *new* or *modified* API endpoints and backend logic needed for mobile, explicitly referencing the categories from `README.md`:
    - **Authentication System**: Implement token-based authentication (e.g., using `profile_uuid` as a token in custom headers) and mobile-specific authentication middleware.
    - **Sync Infrastructure**: Add `last_modified_timestamp` fields to relevant tables and design bulk sync endpoints for efficient mobile synchronization, including conflict resolution logic.
    - **BLE Scale Data Storage**: Define API endpoints and database schema for storing high-frequency weight readings and managing weighing sessions.
    - **Mobile-Optimized Endpoints**: Identify and specify any additional endpoints or modifications for enhanced meal retrieval, bulk operations, or mobile-specific data formats.
- **Database Schema Additions**: Specify the concrete database changes required, such as adding `last_modified_timestamp` columns to existing tables and creating a new `weight_readings` table.
- **Authentication Token Details**: Formalize the token-based authentication approach, including how the `profile_uuid` will be transmitted (e.g., `X-Profile-UUID` header) and how the backend will validate it.

### 0.3 Risk Mitigation & Safety
- **Mandatory Pre-Modification Assessment**: Ensure Phase 0.1 backend assessment is fully complete before any backend modifications are initiated.
- **Incremental Backend Development**: Implement new features and modifications in a way that avoids altering existing functionality, ensuring backward compatibility with the web interface.
- **Comprehensive Data Backup Strategy**: Establish automated and verified backup procedures for the production database *before* any schema changes or data migrations, including off-site storage and verification steps (as detailed in the "Family Data Safety - Enhanced Planning" in `backend_api_audit.md`).
- **Isolated Development Environment**: Utilize an isolated development environment with a copy of family data for testing to prevent accidental impact on production data.
- **Robust Rollback Planning**: Develop and test clear procedures to revert any backend changes (code or database) to a previous stable state if issues arise.

**üìã DELIVERABLES**: Simple, safe plan to get mobile working fast
