# CalorieTrackerMobile

## 1. Overview

CalorieTrackerMobile is a Flutter-based mobile application designed as a mobile client for the [Sprite287/CalorieTracker](https://github.com/Sprite287/CalorieTracker) web backend. This **private family application** serves less than 5 family members and provides comprehensive calorie and nutritional intake tracking, food logging, and weight management with a unique BLE integration feature.

The key innovation of this application is its direct integration with the Decent Scale via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for real-time weight readings, providing a seamless weighing experience that the web interface cannot offer.

**Important Context:**
- **Private Family Use**: This application is designed exclusively for family members, with manual configuration and USB deployment by the developer.
- **No Commercial Distribution**: The app will not be distributed through app stores or commercial channels.
- **Developer-Managed**: All deployment, configuration, and maintenance is handled directly by the developer.
- **Backend Assessment Required**: **CRITICAL** - Phase 0 backend assessment must be completed before any backend modifications.

This README provides an overview of the project, its features, technology stack, setup, and development plan. The detailed, phased development plan can be found in `PHASETREE.md`.

## 2. Backend Integration Status & Requirements

### **CRITICAL: Current Backend Assessment**

The existing CalorieTracker backend provides **substantial API coverage** but requires **careful analysis and targeted modifications** for full mobile integration.

#### **‚úÖ Existing API Capabilities (Ready for Mobile)**
The backend already includes these mobile-ready endpoints:
- **Profile Management**: GET/POST/DELETE `/api/profiles`, `/api/profile/<name>`
- **Food Logging**: POST `/api/add_food`, GET `/api/food_database/<profile>`
- **Food Database Management**: POST `/api/food_database/<profile>`, DELETE `/api/food_database/<profile>/<food_name>`
- **Meal Management**: PUT/DELETE `/api/log/<profile>/<date>/<meal_type>/<food_id>` (update/delete meal entries)
- **Weight Tracking**: GET/POST `/api/weight/<profile>`, GET `/api/weight_history/<profile>`
- **Data Retrieval**: GET `/api/home`, `/api/summary`, `/api/history/<profile>`
- **Goal Management**: GET/POST `/api/goal/<profile>`
- **Visualization Data**: GET `/api/calorie_graph/<profile>` (for charts and graphs)

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Modifications Required (Phase 4)**
**IMPORTANT**: These modifications are **more extensive** than initially planned and require careful implementation:

1. **Sync Infrastructure** (NEW - Critical for mobile)
   - `last_modified_timestamp` fields on all relevant tables
   - Bulk sync endpoints for efficient mobile synchronization
   - Conflict resolution logic implementation

2. **Authentication System** (NEW - Required for mobile)
   - API token generation and validation system
   - Per-device token management
   - Mobile-specific authentication middleware

3. **BLE Scale Data Storage** (NEW - For Decent Scale integration)
   - `weight_readings` table for high-frequency scale data
   - Session management for weighing events
   - Device tracking for family support

4. **Mobile-Optimized Endpoints** (Enhancement - fewer than initially planned)
   - Enhanced meal retrieval with date filtering
   - Bulk sync endpoint for efficiency
   - Mobile-specific data formats

#### **üîí Backend Safety Requirements**
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All modifications must maintain backward compatibility with existing web interface
- **Incremental Development**: New features added alongside existing functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full regression testing of web interface after each backend change
- **Data Integrity**: All database modifications must preserve existing family data

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential packages to reduce complexity

## 5. Project Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture optimized for family use:

*   **Mobile Client (Flutter):** Handles user interaction, BLE communication with the Decent Scale, local data caching, and synchronization with the backend.
*   **Web Backend (`Sprite287/CalorieTracker`):** Serves as the central data repository, manages family profiles, and provides API endpoints for the mobile client.

**Key Architectural Considerations:**
*   **Backend API Enhancement**: The existing CalorieTracker backend requires **significant but carefully planned** API enhancements to support mobile client integration.
*   **Family Data Isolation**: Each mobile device is configured for a specific family member's profile, ensuring data privacy.
*   **Offline-First Design**: Mobile app functions fully offline, with periodic sync to the backend.
*   **Backward Compatibility**: All backend modifications must preserve existing web interface functionality.

Key architectural patterns used in the mobile application:

*   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data sources (local database, remote API, and BLE).
*   **Riverpod:** For reactive state management across the application.
*   **Smart Client Pattern:** Mobile app serves as an intelligent client to the existing web backend.
